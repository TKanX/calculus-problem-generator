# Calculus Problem Generator

Calculus Problem Generator is a simple web application that generates calculus problems based on a user-provided integer input. The generated problem is designed such that its solution matches the input value.

## Features

- Input an integer, and the app generates a calculus problem whose solution equals the input.
- Dynamically renders mathematical expressions using [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).
- Clean and user-friendly interface.

## How to Use

1. Open the application in your browser. (Use a local server to avoid CORS issues if applicable.)
2. Enter an integer in the input field (e.g., `10`).
3. A calculus problem will be displayed, designed such that its solution equals the entered integer.
